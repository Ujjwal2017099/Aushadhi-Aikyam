<h2>Problem : </h2>
<li>People have to spend to much amount on their medicines. And if they want to save something from that amount they have to spend a lot of time on online searching for different sellers of that perticular medicine.
<li>So we are trying to came up with a solution which saves both time and money

<h3>What is the Solution</h3>
<li>User can enter any medicine name in the search bar and it will scrape the details of that medicine from different websites like 1mg , pharmeasy , netmeds and appolopharmasy
<li>User can also upload your doctor's prescription and it will extract medicine name from that prescription and then you can select which medicine you want
<li>User can also login to it's search history
<li>It also contains a telegram chat-bot that offers same services to the user as the website does.

<h3>Why chat-bot?</h3>
<li>Because chat-bot is more easy to use and very convinient.
<li>User does not have to open a website and login , search and view history but with a chat-bot it all at one place without doing anything and user does not have to install any other application for this specific purpose

<h2> Some ScreenShots of the application are shown below: </h2>
